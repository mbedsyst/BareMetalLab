# Baremetal Lab
A project to understand the embedded software development lifecycle without relying on IDEs or GUIs, centered on the STM32F401 microcontroller. It emphasizes manual configuration, development, and debugging of baremetal firmware, utilizing open-source tools such as GCC, OpenOCD, and GDB for comprehensive debugging and analysis.
